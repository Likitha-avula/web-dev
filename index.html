    <p>
        Insurance is a contract, represented by a policy, in which a policyholder receives financial protection or reimbursement against losses from an insurance company. The company pools clients’ risks to make payments more affordable for the insured. Most
        people have some insurance: for their car, their house, their healthcare, or their life.
